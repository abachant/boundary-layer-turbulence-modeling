- question: Can we "discover" a new RANS model from DNS data?
  hypotheses:
    - Yes, there is some other quantity we can compute from existing RANS
      variables that will close the equations. We should be able to do this
      numerically. We can validate by creating a turbulence model and running
      it on a similar geometry.
    - No, there is not enough information present in the mean fields to
      compute the mean fields themselves since the exact equations are
      nonlinear.
