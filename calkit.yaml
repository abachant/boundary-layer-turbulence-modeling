questions:
  - Can we add some new terms to the steady RANS equations to make the mean
    flow match DNS data?
datasets:
  # This is an imported dataset, and currently it's virtual since it doesn't
  # actually exist in the system
  - path: data/jhtdb-transitional-bl/raw
    imported_from: jhtdb/transitional-boundary-layer-dns/data
  # This dataset is an output of a stage in the DVC pipeline
  # We will need to DVC pull it to read
  # Could we just detect this automatically, or is the point to register it in
  # the database so it is declared as a dataset, which could be reused?
